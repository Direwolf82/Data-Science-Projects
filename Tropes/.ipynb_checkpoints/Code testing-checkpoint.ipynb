The film\\'s protagonist, Thomas Anderson, a.k.a. Neo, finds out that this world exists as an illusion created by sentient machines that Turned Against Their Masters and took over the world. The machines plugged humanity into a virtual world — The Matrix — to keep humanity complacent while the machines sapped their bio-electricity to fuel themselves. note\\xa0The Wachowskis intended for the machines to use humanity as a giant neural computer network, but Executive Meddling intervened.Neo eventually finds himself face-to-face with Morpheus, who teaches Neo the truth; Neo reluctantly joins the resistance movement against the machines, which happens in both the real world and The Matrix. \"Free minds\" know The Matrix only resembles reality, so they no longer have to follow certain inconvenient rules (such as gravity) while \"jacked in.\" (They do have one rule they cannot escape, though: Death in the Matrix means brain death in the real world.) The Matrix has its own defense force, both inside the system (programs known as Agents that can bend the rules of the Matrix) and outside it (hunting machines known as Sentinels.) Neo eventually finds his place as a foretold hero and sets out to free mankind from the Matrix; in the process of this self-discovery, Neo defeats one of the Agents — Smith — and sends the others running in terror.'],\n",
